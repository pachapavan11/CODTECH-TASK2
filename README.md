## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
## STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
The Student Grade Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help users efficiently manage and analyze student grades for various subjects or assignments. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Features:
Add Grades:

Users can input grades for specific subjects or assignments.
Each subject is associated with a unique grade.
Edit Grades:

Allows users to update grades for existing subjects.
Calculate Average:

Automatically computes the average grade based on all entered grades.
Determine Letter Grade:

Converts the average grade into a standard letter grade:
A for 90-100
B for 80-89
C for 70-79
D for 60-69
F for below 60
Determine GPA:

Provides a GPA value on a 4.0 scale corresponding to the average grade.
Display Grades:

Outputs a list of all subjects with their respective grades.
## Overall Summary:

Displays:
The average grade
The corresponding letter grade
The GPA
## Technical Details:
Class-Based Design:

The program uses a StudentGrades class to encapsulate all grade-related functionality (e.g., adding, calculating, and displaying grades).
Data Storage:

Grades are stored in a Python dictionary with subjects as keys and their corresponding grades as values.
Data Validation:

Ensures only valid numeric grades are entered.
Provides error messages for invalid inputs.
User Interaction:

Command-line interface (CLI) with clear prompts for user inputs.
## OUTPUT
Enter the number of subjects:  3
Enter subject name:  maths
Enter grade for maths:  95
Enter subject name:  sci
Enter grade for sci:  60
Enter subject name:  soc
Enter grade for soc:  85

Grades:
maths: 95.0
sci: 60.0
soc: 85.0

Overall Grade:
Average Grade: 80.00
Letter Grade: B
GPA: 3.00
